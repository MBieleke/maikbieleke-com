summary: Invited talk at the research seminar of Prof. Dr. Caterina Gawrilow (Department of Psychology, Chair of School Psychology)
abstract: In this talk, I presented the latest research on the self-control strategy of if-then planning. A first focus was on research examining if-then planning effects in the domain of sports. A second focus was on individual differences in the propensity to engage in if-then planning. In the final part of the talk, I characterized if-then planning as an important guiding signal for regulating effort.
