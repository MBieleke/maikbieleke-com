Today was the first meeting of our new research initiative "**ProPELL** - **Pro**moting **P**hysical **E**xercise in **L**ab and **L**ife". The research initiative is sponsored by the Committee for Research Questions (AFF) at the University of Konstanz. Its goal is to understand the psychological and physiological processes involved in physical training, pooling expertise from sports science, psychology, and data analysis. In particular, the dynamic interactions of these processes over time will be investigated with the goal of deriving an effective intervention to combat physical inactivity.

The project runs from 01.03.2022 to 28.02.2024 with Prof. Dr. Julia Sch端ler as speaker and Dr. Maik Bieleke as coordinator. Researchers from the departments of Sports Science (Prof. Dr. Julia Sch端ler, Prof. Dr. Markus Gruber, Prof. Dr. Martina Kanning, Prof. Dr. Ursula Fischer and myself), Psychology (Prof. Dr. Jens Pr端ssner, Prof. Dr. Daniela Mier) and Computer and Information Science (Prof. Dr. Daniel Keim) at the University of Konstanz are involved in ProPELL as project partners.
