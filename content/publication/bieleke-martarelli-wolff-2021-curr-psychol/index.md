abstract: 'In the wake of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), social distancing
  is instrumental for containing the pandemic. To maximize its effectiveness, it is
  paramount to investigate psychological factors that predict adherence to social
  distancing guidelines and examine corresponding interventions. We focused on individual
  differences in if-then planning, self-control, and boredom, and tested an intervention
  based on if-then planning. We conducted a two-wave longitudinal study combining
  observational and experimental methods. Participants (N = 574, 35.7% female, age:
  M = 37.5 years, SD = 10.8) reported their adherence to social distancing guidelines
  and the perceived difficulty of adherence at T1, along with trait measures of if-then
  planning, self-control, and boredom. Afterwards, they were randomly assigned to
  an if-then planning intervention to increase adherence, or to a control intervention.
  One week later at T2, participants again reported their adherence and the perceived
  difficulty of adhering. Multiple regression and structural equation modeling were
  used to establish whether trait if-then planning, self-control, and boredom predicted
  adherence, and to examine the effects of the if-then planning intervention. Trait
  if-then planning, self-control, and boredom were associated with T1 adherence, while
  only if-then planning and boredom predicted T2 adherence. No overall treatment effect
  of the if-then planning intervention emerged; however, participants who complied
  with the intervention (75.6%) maintained higher levels of adherence over time than
  control participants. In sum, individual differences in if-then planning, self-control,
  and boredom predicted adherence to social distancing guidelines. If-then planning
  interventions are promising but require further steps to ascertain compliance.'
