abstract: If-then action planning (i.e., implementation intentions; Gollwitzer, 1999)
  is an effective self-regulation strategy. It entails mentally linking an intended
  action to a critical situation in a verbal if-then plan (e.g., ``If I enter the
  cafeteria, then I will buy an apple''). Formulating such a plan increases the likelihood
  of actually performing the intended action as soon as the specified critical situation
  arises. Importantly, the initiation of the planned action exhibits features of automaticity
  (i.e., fast, efficient, and without requiring another conscious intent; Bargh, 1994).
  Thus, if-then planning is an intriguing instance of how ``controlled'' conscious
  thought at one point in time can lead to ``automatic'' action at a later point in
  time.
