abstract: Choosing among different options is costly. Typically, response times are
  slower if participants can choose between several alternatives (free-choice) compared
  to when a stimulus determines a single correct response (forced-choice). This performance
  difference is commonly attributed to additional cognitive processing in free-choice
  tasks, which require time-consuming decisions between response options. Alternatively,
  the forced-choice advantage might result from facilitated perceptual processing,
  a prediction derived from the framework of implementation intentions. This hypothesis
  was tested in three experiments. Experiments 1 and 2 were PRP experiments and showed
  the expected underadditive interaction of the SOA manipulation and task type, pointing
  to a pre-central perceptual origin of the performance difference. Using the additive-factors
  logic, Experiment 3 further supported this view. We discuss the findings in the
  light of alternative accounts and offer potential mechanisms underlying performance
  differences in forced- and free-choice tasks.
