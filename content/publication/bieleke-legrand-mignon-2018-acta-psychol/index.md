abstract: Forming implementation intentions (i.e., if-then planning) is a powerful
  self-regulation strategy that enhances goal attainment by facilitating the automatic
  initiation of goal-directed responses upon encountering critical situations. Yet,
  little is known about the consequences of forming implementation intentions for
  goal attainment in situations that were not specified in the if-then plan. In three
  experiments, we assessed goal attainment in terms of speed and accuracy in an object
  classification task, focusing on situations that were similar or dissimilar to critical
  situations and required planned or different responses. The results of Experiments
  1 and 3 provide evidence for a facilitation of planned responses in critical and
  in sufficiently similar situations, enhancing goal attainment when the planned response
  was required and impairing it otherwise. In Experiment 3, additional unfavorable
  effects however emerged in situations that were dissimilar to the critical one but
  required the planned response as well. We discuss theoretical implications as well
  as potential benefits and pitfalls emerging from these non-planned effects of forming
  implementation intentions.
