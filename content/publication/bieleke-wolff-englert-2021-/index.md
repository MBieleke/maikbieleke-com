abstract: If-then planning (implementation intentions) describes a self-regulatory
  strategy that helps people to attain their goals across a variety of domains, such
  as achieving physical activity goals. Based on such beneficial effects, if-then
  plans are anecdotally discussed as a strategy to enhance sports-related performance
  as well. However, this discussion currently lacks an empirical basis. We therefore
  conducted a scoping review to identify experimental research on the effects of if-then
  planning on sports-related performance, potential moderators of these effects, the
  methodological approaches used, and the suitability of the available evidence for
  assessing the effectiveness of if-then planning in sports. Based on a search of
  four online databases, we identified a set of 11 studies that investigated if-then
  planning in experimental research with sports-related performance as an outcome
  measure. Six of these studies focused on if-then planning in endurance tasks, whereas
  the remaining studies investigated sports performance in domains that do not revolve
  primarily around endurance (e. g., tennis, golf, darts). The samples were often
  small and comprised university students; the conclusions drawn regarding the effectiveness
  of if-then planning for improving sports-related performance were rather heterogeneous.
  Still, most studies did shed light on tentative mechanisms (e. g., perceptions of
  effort and pain, arousal) and moderators (e. g., athletes' beliefs about their performance
  limits, the feasibility of the behavior) of if-then planning in sports, guiding
  future research regarding the question of when and for whom if-then planning might
  be a beneficial strategy. Based on these findings, we identify the potentials and
  pitfalls of using if-then plans to enhance sports-related performance, discuss promising
  routes for future research, and derive practical implications for athletes and coaches.
