abstract: Arguably, extreme sports athletes exhibit a more significant risk appetite
  than the general public. Are standard behavioral risk measures able to capture this?
  To answer this question, we assessed self-reports of risk taking and measured the
  risk-taking behavior of samples of snowboarders and climbers. Two groups of non-athletes,
  university students and crowdworkers, and athletes of a sport that does not include
  the potential of grave injury or death, esports athletes, serve as control conditions
  and complement our study. Across these five different groups, 1313 participants
  performed an online version of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) and gave self-reports
  of general willingness to take risks and sports-specific risk taking. Extreme sports
  athletes exhibited greater risk taking in the BART than non-athletes and esports
  athletes. Furthermore, BART-performance predicted sports-specific risk taking and
  its affective consequences. Our results speak to the BART's ecological validity
  and the unique role of physical consequences on risk-taking behavior.
