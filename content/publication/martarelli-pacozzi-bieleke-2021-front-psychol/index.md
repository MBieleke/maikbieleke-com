abstract: In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) schools around the
  world have been closed to protect against the spread of coronavirus. In several
  countries, homeschooling has been introduced to replace classroom schooling. With
  a focus on individual differences, the present study examined 138 schoolers (age
  range = 6 to 21 years) regarding their self-control and boredom proneness. The results
  showed that both traits were important in predicting adherence to homeschooling.
  Schoolers with higher levels of self-control perceived homeschooling as less difficult,
  which in turn increased homeschooling adherence. In contrast, schoolers with higher
  levels of boredom proneness perceived homeschooling as more difficult, which in
  turn reduced homeschooling adherence. These results partially hold when it comes
  to studying in the classroom. However, boredom threatened adherence only in the
  homeschooling context. Our results indicate that boredom proneness is a critical
  construct to consider when educational systems switch to homeschooling during a
  pandemic.
