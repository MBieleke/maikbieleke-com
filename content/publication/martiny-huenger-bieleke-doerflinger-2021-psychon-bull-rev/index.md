abstract: Deliberation is commonly assumed to be a central characteristic of humans'
  higher cognitive functions, and the responses following deliberation are attributed
  to mechanisms that are qualitatively different from lower-level associative or affectively
  driven responses. In contrast to this perspective, the current article's aim is
  to draw attention to potential issues with making inferences about mechanisms of
  deliberation based on characteristics of the observed decision outcomes. We propose
  that a consequence of deliberation is to simply reduce the likelihood of expressing
  immediately available (dominant) responses. We illustrate how this consequence of
  deliberation can provide a parsimonious explanation for a broad range of prior research
  on decision-making. Furthermore, we discuss how the present perspective on deliberation
  relates to the question of how the cognitive system implements nondominant responses
  based on associative learning and affective prioritization rather than voluntary
  decisions. Beyond the present article's theoretical focus, for illustrative purposes,
  we provide some empirical evidence (three studies, N = 175) that is in line with
  our proposal. In sum, our theoretical framework, prior empirical evidence, and the
  present studies suggest that deliberation reduces the likelihood of expressing dominant
  responses. Although we do not argue that this is the only consequence or mechanism
  regarding deliberation, we aim to highlight that it is worthwhile considering this
  minimal consequence of deliberation as compared with certain higher cognitive functions
  in the interpretation of deliberation outcomes.
