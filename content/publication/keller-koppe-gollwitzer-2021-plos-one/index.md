abstract: The tendency to be overly confident in one's future and skills has long
  been studied. More recently, a correlate of this overconfidence, the tendency to
  overclaim knowledge, has been in the focus of research. Its antecedents and downstream
  behavioral consequences are still in question. In a sample of undergraduate students
  (N = 168), we tested whether a set of characteristics of the person (e.g., age,
  gender) and personality traits (i.e., the Dark Triad) is related to overclaiming
  knowledge. Moreover, we investigated whether overclaiming, in turn, predicts risk
  preferences. To this end, we asked individuals to rate their confidence in solving
  a set of different math problems and their familiarity with a set of math concepts.
  Some of these concepts were nonexistent, thereby allowing participants to overclaim
  knowledge. Participants then stated their general risk preference and performed
  three tasks revealing their general, financial, and social risk preferences. We
  demonstrated the hypothesized relationship between overclaiming and confidence.
  Furthermore, we observed that the assessed characteristics of the person were not
  correlated with overclaiming. If anything, height and digit ratio, a phenomenological
  correlate of hormonal differences during development, tended to be associated with
  overclaiming. Surprisingly, overclaiming was not at all related to risk preferences
  or personality traits. This set of results shows the need for relevant theoretical
  and methodological refinements.
