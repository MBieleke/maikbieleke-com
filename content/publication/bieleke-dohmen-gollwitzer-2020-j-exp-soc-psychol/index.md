abstract: 'Insights into the processes underlying observed decisions are crucial for
  a comprehensive understanding of behavior. We investigate how individual social
  value orientation (SVO) relates to controlled information acquisition and how this
  relationship may be governed by intuitive versus reflective decision modes. We measure
  controlled information acquisition with the process tracing tool Mouselab and demonstrate
  its potential for advancing research on social decision-making. In two experiments,
  participants worked on two consecutive SVO tasks, in which they allocated points
  between themselves and others. Information regarding the available distributions
  of points had to be actively acquired by moving the mouse cursor over corresponding
  boxes on the screen. We observed a stable relationship between SVO and controlled
  information acquisition in both experiments: less selfish participants acquired
  more information and made more other-oriented acquisitions, and this relationship
  showed up in both an intuitive and a reflective decision mode. However, participants
  in a reflective decision mode acquired more information, their acquisitions were
  more strongly other-oriented, and their decisions were more prosocial compared to
  participants in an intuitive mode. Taken together, our results advance research
  on SVO by showing that non-selfish individuals invest considerable time and effort
  to gauge the consequences of their decisions for others, which might underlie the
  pervasive effects of SVO on many socially relevant behaviors. Moreover, we demonstrate
  how intuitive versus reflective decision modes can alter controlled information
  acquisition. Finally, our results illustrate that Mouselab is a simple-to-use and
  versatile tool for tracing cognitive processes underlying social psychological phenomena.'
