abstract: Making if-then plans is a self-regulation strategy that facilitates goal
  attainment. An open question is, however, whether there are individual differences
  in if-then planning. We, therefore, developed and validated the If-Then Planning
  Scale (ITPS) in three independent studies with more than 2600 participants. The
  ITPS is conceptually grounded in implementation intention theory, measuring whether
  individuals identify critical situations (if-part) and plan goal-directed behaviors
  (then-part) in terms of opportunities and obstacles. We established the psychometric
  qualities of the ITPS in Studies 1a and 1b and its convergent and discriminant validity
  in Studies 2 and 3. Applying the ITPS, we showed that if-then planning is associated
  with the attainment of environmental goals (Studies 1a and 1b), socioeconomic status
  (Studies 1a, 1b, and 2), and academic achievement (Study 3). Our results demonstrate
  individual differences in if-then planning that can be efficiently and reliably
  measured with the ITPS, and reveal systematic associations between these individual
  differences and goal attainment.
