abstract: "Relationship quality and emotional experience are both important constructs\
  \ in learning environments but the question of how they are linked requires more\
  \ attention in empirical research. We hypothesized reciprocal associations between\
  \ student-teacher relationship quality (i.e., interpersonal closeness) and students'\
  \ emotions in the classroom (i.e., enjoyment, pride, anxiety, anger, boredom, and\
  \ shame). Data from a two-wave longitudinal study with annual assessments in grade\
  \ 10 (Time 1) and 11 (Time 2) were used to test this hypothesis (N = 535; mean age\
  \ at Time 1: 16.7 years, SD = 0.6). Student-perceived relationship quality and students'\
  \ emotions were assessed in the academic domains of mathematics, German, English,\
  \ and French. In line with our hypothesis, cross-lagged panel models showed reciprocal\
  \ associations: Higher relationship quality was associated with stronger positive\
  \ emotions and weaker negative emotions over time. In turn, lower negative emotions\
  \ and higher positive emotions were associated with higher relationship quality.\
  \ The association between initial emotions and student-teacher relationship quality\
  \ one year later was stronger than the reverse association. Further, the links between\
  \ relationship quality and emotions were largely equivalent across school domains\
  \ but differed in strength across emotions. Implications for future research and\
  \ educational practice are discussed."
