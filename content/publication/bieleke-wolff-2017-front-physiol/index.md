abstract: 'Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) are routinely assessed in exercise
  science and RPE is substantially associated with physiological criterion measures.
  According to the psychobiological model of endurance, RPE is a central limiting
  factor in performance. While RPE is known to be affected by psychological manipulations,
  it remains to be examined whether RPE can be self-regulated during static muscular
  endurance exercises to enhance performance. In this experiment, we investigate the
  effectiveness of the widely used and recommended self-regulation strategy of if-then
  planning (i.e., implementation intentions) in down-regulating RPE and improving
  performance in a static muscular endurance task. 62 female students (age: M = 23.7
  years, SD = 4.0) were randomly assigned to an implementation intention or a control
  condition and performed a static muscular endurance task. They held two intertwined
  rings as long as possible while avoiding contacts between the rings. In the implementation
  intention condition, participants had an if-then plan: textquotedblIf the task becomes
  too strenuous for me, then I ignore the strain and tell myself: Keep going!textquotedbl
  Every 25 $±$ 10 s participants reported their RPE along with their perceived pain.
  Endurance performance was measured as time to failure, along with contact errors
  as a measure of performance quality. No differences emerged between implementation
  intention and control participants regarding time to failure and performance quality.
  However, mixed-effects model analyses revealed a significant Time-to-Failure $times$
  Condition interaction for RPE. Compared to the control condition, participants in
  the implementation intention condition reported substantially greater increases
  in RPE during the second half of the task and reached higher total values of RPE
  before task termination. A similar but weaker pattern evinced for perceived pain.
  Our results demonstrate that RPE during an endurance task can be self-regulated
  with if-then plans. This finding is particularly important given how frequently
  RPE is used in exercise science as a correlate of physiological processes that ultimately
  limit performance. Unexpectedly, participants with implementation intentions reported
  higher RPE than control participants. This suggests that strategies to self-regulate
  RPE might have ironic effects that hamper performance, maybe by increasing attention
  to RPE. This implication is important for exercise physiologists, athletes and coaches.'
