abstract: Self-control is critical for successful participation and performance in
  sports and therefore has attracted considerable research interest. Yet, knowledge
  about self-control remains surprisingly incomplete and inconsistent. Here, we draw
  attention to boredom as an experience that likely plays an important role in sports
  and exercise (e.g., exercise can be perceived as boring but can also be used to
  alleviate boredom). Specifically, we argue that studying boredom in the context
  of sports and exercise will also advance our understanding of self-control as a
  reward-based choice. We demonstrate this by discussing evidence for links between
  self-control and boredom and by highlighting the role boredom plays for guiding
  goal-directed behavior. As such, boredom is likely to interact with self-control
  in affecting sports performance and exercise participation. We close by highlighting
  several promising routes for integrating self-control and boredom research in the
  context of sports performance and exercise behavior.
