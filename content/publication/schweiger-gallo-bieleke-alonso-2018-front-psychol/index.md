abstract: As anger can lead to aggressive behavior aiming at intentionally hurting
  somebody, the prevention of its destructive consequences with effective emotion
  regulation strategies is crucial. Two studies tested the idea that mental contrasting
  with implementation intentions (MCII) interventions would be effective in down-regulating
  anger. In Study 1, participants who adopted the self-regulation strategy of MCII
  showed significantly less anger-related negative affect after the anger induction
  than participants in a control condition, with positive affect staying unaffected.
  Results from a second study with a control condition plus three self-regulation
  conditions - a reappraisal, a MCII, and a reappraisal + MCII condition - suggest
  that participants using MCII were effective in down-regulating anger, irrespective
  of whether it was supplemented by reappraisal or not. The present research contributes
  to emotion regulation research by introducing MCII as an effective strategy that
  can be tailored to satisfy individual emotion regulation demands, such as dealing
  with experienced anger.
