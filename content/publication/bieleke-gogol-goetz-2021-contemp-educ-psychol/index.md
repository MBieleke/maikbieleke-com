abstract: The Achievement Emotions Questionnaire (AEQ) is a well-established instrument
  for measuring achievement emotions in educational research and beyond. Its popularity
  rests on the coverage of the component structure of various achievement emotions
  across different academic settings. However, this broad conceptual scope requires
  the administration of 6 to 12 items per scale (Mdn = 10), which limits the applicability
  of the AEQ in empirical studies that necessitate brief administration times. We
  therefore developed the AEQ-S, a short version of the AEQ, with only 4 items per
  scale that nevertheless maintain the conceptual scope of the instrument. We validated
  the AEQ-S based on a reanalysis of Pekrun, Goetz, Frenzel, Barchfeld, and Perry's
  (2011) dataset (N = 389 university students) and by administering them to a new
  and independent validation sample (N = 471 university students). Despite their brevity,
  the AEQ-S scales achieved satisfactory reliability and correlated substantially
  with the original AEQ scales. Moreover, structural relationships and intercorrelations
  between the scales and their relations with external measures of antecedents and
  outcomes of achievement emotions were highly similar for the AEQ-S and AEQ scales.
  These findings suggest that the AEQ-S is a suitable substitute for the AEQ when
  administration time is limited.
