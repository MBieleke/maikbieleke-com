abstract: Social distancing during the coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
  is crucial to reduce the spread of the virus. However, its effectiveness hinges
  on adherence by individuals who face substantial burdens from the required behavioral
  restrictions. Here, we investigate sources of individual variation in adhering to
  social distancing guidelines. In a high-powered study (N = 895), we tested direct
  and indirect effects of boredom and self-control on adherence. The results showed
  that both traits were important predictors of adherence but the underlying mechanisms
  differed. Specifically, individuals high in boredom perceived social distancing
  as more difficult, which in turn reduced their adherence (i.e., a mediated effect).
  In contrast, individuals high in self-control adhered more to the guidelines without
  perceiving them as more or less difficult; however, self-control moderated the effect
  of difficulty on adherence. Our results are immediately relevant to improve the
  efficacy of social distancing guidelines in the COVID-19 response.
