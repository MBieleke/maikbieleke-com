abstract: Volleyball serves constitute an important example for a self-controlled
  sequence of actions in sports that is difficult to improve. It is therefore paramount
  to investigate whether and how conveying self-control strategies to athletes affects
  their service performance. To address this question, we conducted a pilot field
  study with sixty-two players from four Swiss volleyball schools. They performed
  a warm-up and subsequently a first series of 15 serves. Objective service performance
  was measured in terms of errors, velocity, and precision. Afterwards, players formulated
  either individual goals (goal condition) or plans (plan condition) based on their
  coaches' correction instructions. In a second series of 15 serves objective performance
  was worse in some respects compared to the first series (i.e., more errors in the
  plan condition, reduced precision in both conditions). Mixed-effects analyses of
  performance development across conditions in the second series showed initially
  reduced but steadily recouping precision and velocity, while the number of errors
  stayed constant. In contrast to the objective performance, coaches evaluated their
  players' service performance during the second series of serves as substantially
  better than during the first series. Taken together, the results of this pilot field
  study suggest that conveying either goals or plans as self-control strategies may
  involve initial adjustment costs followed by a subsequent recovery period.
