abstract: Implementation intentions (Gollwitzer, 1993, 1999, 2014) are if-then plans
  that help individuals attain their goals. Implementation intentions have proven
  beneficial in various domains in which individuals fall short of attaining their
  goals, from health behavior through academic achievement to interpersonal issues
  (for reviews, see Adriaanse, Vinkers, De Ridder, Hox, & De Wit, 2011; BÃ©langer-Gravel,
  Godin, & Amireault, 2013; Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006; Gollwitzer, 2014; Hagger &
  Luszczynska, 2014). The aim of this chapter is to present research on how implementation
  intentions influence the affective, cognitive and conative components of consumer
  behavior. We outline the nature of implementation intentions and describe moderators
  and mediators identified in previous research. Next, we adopt the perspective of
  comprehensive models of consumer behavior (e.g., Bettman, 1979; Blackwell, Miniard,
  & Engel, 2006; Howard & Sheth, 1969) and systematically review implementation intention
  effects along the lines of these models. Specifically, we describe how implementation
  intentions affect information acquisition (i.e., perception, processing and comprehension),
  components of the decision process (i.e., pre- and post-decisional evaluation) and
  internal and external influences on behavior (i.e., affect, norms, priming and mimicry)
  in consumer context. We conclude by outlining topics for future research on implementation
  intentions in the domain of consumer behavior.
