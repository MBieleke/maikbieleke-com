abstract: Self-regulatory control plays a key role in determining sports performance.
  To illustrate, a runner whose muscles are aching has to fight the impulse of slowing
  down. This impulse can be understood as a self-regulatory control demand and only
  effective control of this impulse might allow the runner to win the race. In recent
  years, cognitive neuroscience has substantially advanced the theoretical and mechanistic
  understanding of self-regulatory control processes. In this chapter, we will introduce
  the expected value of control (EVC) theory as a sound theoretical framework that
  conceptualizes self-regulatory control as a reward-based choice that is aimed at
  maximizing the EVC. This suggests that sports performance hinges on the outcome
  of the continuous cost-benefit calculation whether or not the value of applying
  control outweighs its costs. Control processes are orchestrated by structures in
  the executive network, namely the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the lateral
  prefrontal cortex. Recent technological developments have substantially facilitated
  research on brain activity during sports performance and this has led to a surge
  in neuroscientific research on self-regulatory control in sports. Here, we will
  summarize research on the involvement of these areas in regard to self-regulatory
  control in sports.
