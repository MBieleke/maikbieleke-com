abstract: The strength model of self-control proposes that all acts of self-control
  are energized by one global limited resource that becomes temporarily depleted by
  a primary self-control task, leading to impaired self-control performance in secondary
  self-control tasks. However, failed replications have cast doubt on the existence
  of this so-called ego depletion effect. Here, we investigated between-task (i.e.,
  variation in self-control tasks) and within-task variation (i.e., task duration)
  as possible explanations for the conflicting literature on ego depletion effects.
  In a high-powered experiment (N = 709 participants), we used two established self-control
  tasks (Stroop task, transcription task) to test how variations in the duration of
  primary and secondary self-control tasks (2, 4, 8, or 16~min per task) affect the
  occurrence of an ego depletion effect (i.e., impaired performance in the secondary
  task). In line with the ego depletion hypothesis, subjects perceived longer lasting
  secondary tasks as more self-control demanding. Contrary to the ego depletion hypothesis,
  however, performance did neither suffer from prior self-control exertion, nor as
  a function of task duration. If anything, performance tended to improve when the
  primary self-control task lasted longer. These effects did not differ between the
  two self-control tasks, suggesting that the observed null findings were independent
  of task type.
