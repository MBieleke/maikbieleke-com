abstract: 'In an effort to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries
  around the world have employed non-pharmaceutical containment measures. The effectiveness
  of such mitigation efforts relies on individual compliance (e.g., avoiding to travel
  or to gather). Crucially, adhering to the required behavioral recommendations places
  substantial burdens on those who are asked to follow them. One particularly likely
  outcome of adherence should be the experience of boredom. Thus, people might get
  bored by bothering. Drawing from research and theorizing on reward-based decision
  making, we conducted a high-powered study (N = 1553 US participants) to investigate
  whether the value and effort people ascribe to adherence to containment measures
  directly and indirectly (i.e., mediated by adherence) affects their experience of
  boredom. As expected, structural equation modeling revealed that high value and
  low effort predicted compliance with behavioral recommendations. Moreover, higher
  compliance was linked to more boredom, meaning that high value and low effort increased
  boredom via compliance. In contrast, high value and low effort had direct effects
  on boredom in the opposite direction (i.e., decreasing boredom). Attesting to their
  robustness and generalizability, these findings held for both prospective (with
  respect to upcoming winter holidays) and retrospective behavior (with respect to
  previous thanksgiving holidays), across US states, which had or had not enforced
  behavioral restrictions, individual differences in boredom proneness, and demographic
  variables. Taken together, our results provide evidence that people can indeed get
  bored by bothering: Complying with nonpharmacological containment measures like
  avoiding to travel and to gather can come at the cost of getting bored, an experience
  that was strongly linked to negative affect in our study.'
