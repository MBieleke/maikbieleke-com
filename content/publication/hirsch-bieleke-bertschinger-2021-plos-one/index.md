abstract: "Endurance sports pose a plethora of mental demands that exercisers have\
  \ to deal with. Unfortunately, investigations of exercise-specific demands and strategies\
  \ to deal with them are insufficiently researched, leading to a gap in knowledge\
  \ about athletic requirements and strategies used to deal with them. Here, we investigated\
  \ which obstacles exercisers experience during an anaerobic (Wingate test) and an\
  \ aerobic cycling test (incremental exercise test), as well as the strategies they\
  \ considered helpful for dealing with these obstacles (qualitative analysis). In\
  \ addition, we examined whether thinking of these obstacles and strategies in terms\
  \ of if-then plans (or implementation intentions; i.e., ``If I encounter obstacle\
  \ O, then I will apply strategy S!'') improves performance over merely setting performance\
  \ goals (i.e., goal intentions; quantitative analysis). N = 59 participants (age:\
  \ M = 23.9 $±$ 6.5 years) performed both tests twice in a 2-within (Experimental\
  \ session: 1 vs. 2) $times$ 2-between (Condition: goal vs. implementation intention)\
  \ design. Exercisers' obstacles and strategies were assessed using structured interviews\
  \ in Session 1 and subjected to thematic analysis. In both tests, feelings of exertion\
  \ were the most frequently stated obstacle. Motivation to do well, self-encouragement,\
  \ and focus on the body and on cycling were frequently stated strategies in both\
  \ tests. There were also test-specific obstacles, such as boredom reported in the\
  \ aerobic test. For session 2, the obstacles and strategies elicited in Session\
  \ 1 were used to specify if-then plans. Bayesian mixed-factor ANOVA suggests, however,\
  \ that if-then plans did not help exercisers to improve their performance. These\
  \ findings shed novel light into the mental processes accompanying endurance exercise\
  \ and the limits they pose on performance."
