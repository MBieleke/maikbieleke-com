abstract: The continuous revaluation of rewards lies at the core of Ainslie's account
  of willpower. Yet, he does not explicate the underlying experiential mechanisms.
  We draw upon theoretical, neuroscientific, and computational evidence to demonstrate
  that boredom evokes revaluation. By biasing behavior toward exploration, boredom
  necessitates effortful willpower to balance it against exploitation, thereby rendering
  suppression a highly adaptive function of willpower.
