abstract: 'Implementation intentions (if-then plans) help people to automatically
  perform goal-directed behaviors when they encounter goal-relevant critical situations.
  Besides the intended beneficial effects on goal attainment, however, goal-directed
  behaviors might entail various costs. Successful goal striving then requires flexible
  tenacity: tenaciously holding on to behaviors that inflict bearable costs but flexibly
  backing off from performing excessively costly behaviors. In the present research,
  we investigated whether goal striving with implementation intentions is characterized
  by such flexible tenacity. In Experiments 1 and 2, implementation intention participants
  held on to goal-directed behaviors that inflicted bearable costs (sustaining unpleasant
  noise and annoying effort), whereas participants with mere goal intentions reduced
  their performance of goal-directed behaviors. In Experiment 3, both goal and implementation
  intention participants backed off from performing an excessively costly behavior
  (involving monetary loss). This effect was more pronounced among implementation
  intention participants, who additionally lowered their goal commitment. We conclude
  that implementation intentions render goal striving tenaciously flexible, facilitating
  goal-directed behaviors unless this is associated with excessive costs.'
