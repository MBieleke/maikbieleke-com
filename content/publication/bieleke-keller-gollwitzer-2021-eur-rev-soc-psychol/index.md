abstract: The self-regulation strategy of forming implementation intentions has now
  been studied for almost 30 years. We trace the development of this research and
  explicate the questions that have been addressed. We then present current research
  that investigates the consequences of implementation intentions for flexible goal
  striving, behaviour in situations for which one had not planned, and neuropsychological
  processes underlying the action control by implementation intentions. Next, we turn
  to novel applications focusing on how implementation intentions affect physical
  endurance and promote strategic information processing. Our review concludes with
  an outlook on future research on implementation intentions that covers emerging
  individual difference perspectives, innovative approaches to characterize underlying
  cognitive processes, and the prospects of integrating insights from related fields
  of research. As such, our review is an empathic call for addressing the many intriguing
  conceptual and empirical questions that still revolve around implementation intentions.
