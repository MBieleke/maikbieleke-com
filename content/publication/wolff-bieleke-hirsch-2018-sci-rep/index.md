abstract: Enduring physical strain is an important ability and prototypically required
  in athletic activities. However, little is known about the psychological determinants
  of endurance performance and their underlying neural mechanisms. Here, we investigated
  self-regulation as one such factor. We recruited 60 participants who hold intertwined
  rings for as long as possible while avoiding contacts between them, either with
  a goal intention or an implementation intention to perform well. Performance was
  measured in terms of time-to-failure and contact errors. Additionally, we repeatedly
  assessed ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and pain (RPP) and used functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to continuously monitor cerebral oxygenation
  in dorsal and ventral parts of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), brain regions
  associated with effortful attentional control and response inhibition, respectively.
  Performance, RPE and RPP were similar in the goal and the implementation intention
  condition. LPFC activity increased over time, but its activation level was generally
  lower in the implementation intention condition. Both effects were particularly
  pronounced in the dorsal LPFC. Moreover, the balance between effortful and more
  automatic regulation seems to differ between self-regulation strategies. Our results
  indicate that self-regulation plays an important role in endurance performance and
  that self-regulatory processes during endurance performance might be reflected in
  LPFC activation.
