abstract: "Muscular strength has a strong positive impact on cardiometabolic health\
  \ and fitness. However, building up strength endurance requires effortful exercises.\
  \ From a health perspective, it is important to understand which psychological strategies\
  \ help people deal with straining exercise. Self-regulation strategies like if-then\
  \ planning (also known as implementation intentions) appear particularly promising\
  \ because they might directly alter how people deal with exercise-induced sensations.\
  \ However, research on the effects of if-then planning on exercise performance has\
  \ yielded mixed results so far. One possible reason for these inconsistent results\
  \ is the lack of tailored interventions and the neglect of potential moderators.\
  \ To address this, we investigated the efficacy of if-then plans that were tailored\
  \ to perceived limits of endurance performance (i.e., perceptions of exertion versus\
  \ pain). In addition, we investigated the effects of these tailored if-then plans\
  \ while taking into account the potentially moderating effects of individual differences\
  \ in implicit theories. Specifically, we were interested in the role of implicit\
  \ theories about athletic performance (i.e., entity versus incremental beliefs)\
  \ and about the limitation of athletic performance by mental versus physical factors\
  \ (i.e., mind-over-body beliefs). N = 66 male students (age: M = 25.8 years, SD\
  \ = 3.2) performed a static muscular endurance task twice (measurement: baseline\
  \ task vs. main task) and were randomly assigned to a goal or an implementation\
  \ intention condition. They were instructed to hold two intertwined rings for as\
  \ long as possible while avoiding contacts between them (measure of performance:\
  \ time-to-failure and errors). After the baseline task, participants were either\
  \ given an implementation intention or were simply asked to rehearse the task instructions.\
  \ The content of the instruction depended on whether they ascribed ultimate baseline\
  \ task termination to perceptions of exertion or pain. After the main task, implicit\
  \ theories on athletic ability were assessed. No differences in performance emerged\
  \ between conditions. In the implementation intention condition, however, stronger\
  \ entity beliefs were associated with increasing time-to-failure when participants\
  \ planned to ignore exertion but with decreasing time-to-failure when they planned\
  \ to ignore pain. This pattern of results was reversed with regard to mind-over-body\
  \ beliefs. These findings indicate that the efficacy of psychological strategies\
  \ hinges on recreational athletes' beliefs regarding athletic performance."
