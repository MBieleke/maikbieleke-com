## Boredom is the root of all evil â€” or is it? A psychometric network approach to individual differences in behavioral responses to boredom

In a new preprint, Leonie Ripper, Julia SchÃ¼ler, Wanja Wolff, and I introduce a **new measure of boredom** that (1) captures the urge to avoid or escape boredom, (2) is consistent with function accounts on boredom, and (3) unlike boredom proneness, is linked to both maladaptive and adapative behavior.

For more information, please see the preprint.
