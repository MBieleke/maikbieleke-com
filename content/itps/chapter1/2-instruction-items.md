The ITPS has been developed as a domain-general measure of if-then planning. Accordingly, the instruction refers to goals in general and specifies that participants should think about difficult and important goals (as only these goals require if-then planning to facilitate goal attainment):

This instruction can also be adapted to specific goals (e.g., loosing weight, studying harder) if the focus is on if-then planning in a particular domain. 


The following statements relate to how you approach important and difficult goals in general. Refer to goals that you find worthwhile and rewarding, but which you cannot easily achieve and which really challenge you. Once you have appropriate goals in mind, read each statement and indicate how much it applies to you.
