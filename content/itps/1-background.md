The **If-Then Planning Scale (ITPS)** is a theory-grounded and empirically validated instrument for assessing individual differences in the propensity to make if-then plans in order to facilitate one's goal attainment (e.g., "If I go to the cafeteria, then I will I grab some fruit" when the goal is to eat healthier). The ITPS is conceputally grounded in Gollwitzer's (1999) *implemenentation intention theory* and consists of eight items that tap into whether an individual identifies critical situations (obstacles and opportunities) and specifies corresponding goal-directed behaviors.
