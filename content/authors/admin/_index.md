I'm a senior researcher at the University of Konstanz [Sport Psychology Lab](https://www.sportwissenschaft.uni-konstanz.de/schueler/). In my research, I focus on how people (fail to) attain their goals, and the various physiological and psychological processes that accompany goal-directed behavior. The main emphasis currenmtly is on physical activity and sports behavior in lab and life settings.
