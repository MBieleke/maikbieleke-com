## Background 

The **If-Then Planning Scale (ITPS)** is a theory-grounded and empirically validated instrument for assessing individual differences in the propensity to make if-then plans in order to facilitate one's goal attainment (e.g., "If I go to the cafeteria, then I will I grab some fruit" when the goal is to eat healthier). The ITPS is conceputally grounded in Gollwitzer's (1999) *implemenentation intention theory* and consists of eight items that tap into whether an individual identifies critical situations (obstacles and opportunities) and specifies corresponding goal-directed behaviors.


## Administering and Scoring the ITPS

The ITPS can be administered in an online or in a paper-and-pencil format. Completing it takes about 1-2 minutes. The items should be presented in random order to avoid order effects. Participants rate each of the eight items on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (*strongly disagree*) to 7 (*strongly agree*). An overall score is obtained by averaging a participant's ratings across all eight items. 

### Instructions 

The ITPS has been developed as a domain-general measure of if-then planning. Accordingly, the instruction refers to goals in general and specifies that participants should think about difficult and important goals (as only these goals require if-then planning to facilitate goal attainment):

> The following statements relate to how you approach important and difficult goals in general. Refer to goals that you find worthwhile and rewarding, but which you cannot easily achieve and which really challenge you. Once you have appropriate goals in mind, read each statement and indicate how much it applies to you.

This instruction can also be adapted to specific goals (e.g., loosing weight, studying harder) if the focus is on if-then planning in a particular domain. 

### Items

| # | Item |
| - | - |
| 1 | I think about when and where decisive moments for the achievement of my goals could occur. |
| 2 | I think about chances and possibilities that I could use. |
| 3 | I envisage what obstacles could arise. |
| 4 | I am concerned with what setbacks to expect. |
| 5 | I plan how best to achieve my goals. |
| 6 | I plan the concrete actions I will take toward my goal. |
| 7 | I plan how to protect myself from distractions. |
| 8 | I plan ways in which I can deal with difficulties. |
