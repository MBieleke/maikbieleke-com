abstract: Purpose:~This study aims to take a dual-process perspective and argues that
  peer influence on increasing impulse buying may also operate automatically. If-then
  plans, which can automate action control, may, thus, help regulate peer influence.
  This research extends existing literature explicating the deliberate influence of
  social norms. Design/methodology/approach:~Study 1 (N = 120) obtained causal evidence
  that forming an implementation intention (i.e. an if-then plan designed to automate
  action control) reduces peer impact on impulse buying in a laboratory experiment
  with young adults (students) selecting food items. Study 2 (N = 686) obtained correlational
  evidence for the role of norms, automaticity and implementation intentions in impulse
  buying using a large sample of high-school adolescents working on a vignette about
  clothes-shopping. Findings:~If-then plans reduced impulse purchases in the laboratory
  (Study 1). Both reported deliberation on peer norms and the reported automaticity
  of shopping with peers predicted impulse buying but an implementation intention
  to be thriftily reduced these links (Study 2). Research limitations/implications:~This
  research highlights the role of automatic social processes in problematic consumer
  behaviour. Promising field studies and neuropsychological experiments are discussed.
  Practical implications:~Young consumers can gain control over automatic peer influence
  by using ifthen plans, thereby reducing impulse buying. Originality/value:~This
  research helps understand new precursors of impulse buying in understudied European
  samples of young consumers.
