abstract: 'People often struggle with attaining their goals. One important reason
  for this intention-behavior gap pertains to the difficulties of goal striving: to
  be successful, people must get started, stay on track, and bring their goal pursuits
  to a successful close. We show the importance of goal striving for endurance activities
  and describe the self-regulatory strategy of if-then planning (implementation intentions),
  which is known to facilitate goal striving in several domains. We illustrate when
  and how implementation intentions work, summarise the literature regarding their
  facilitative effects on goal attainment, and discuss their potential for enhancing
  endurance performance.'
