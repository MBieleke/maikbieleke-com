## Introduction 

The **If-Then Planning Scale (ITPS)** is a theory-grounded and validated eight-item instrument for assessing the propensity to engage in if-then planning. It measures whether an individual identifies opportunities and obstacles for goal-directed behavior.


## Administering and Scoring the ITPS

The ITPS can be administered in an online or a paper-and-pencil format and will take about 1-2 minutes. Participants rate each of the eight items on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (*strongly disagree*) to 7 (*strongly agree*). An overall score is then obtained by averaging across all eight items. 

## Instructions 

The ITPS has been developed as a domain-general measure of if-then planning. Accordingly, the instruction refers to goals in general. 
As if-then planning effects are most important when goals are difficult and important, participants are asked to refer to these goals in particular. 

> **Directions:** The following statements relate to how you approach important and difficult goals in general. Refer to goals that you find worthwhile and rewarding, but which you cannot easily achieve and which really challenge you. Once you have appropriate goals in mind, read each statement and indicate how much it applies to you.

The instruction can also be adapted to specific goals (e.g., loosing weight, studying harder) if the focus is on if-then planning in a particular domain.
