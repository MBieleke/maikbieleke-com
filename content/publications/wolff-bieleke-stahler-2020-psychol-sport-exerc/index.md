abstract: "Physical exercise is an effective tool for improving public health, but\
  \ the general population exercises too little. Drawing on recent theorizing on the\
  \ combined role of boredom and self-control in guiding goal-directed behavior, we\
  \ test the hypothesis that individual differences in boredom and self-control differentiate\
  \ high from low exercisers. The role of boredom as a non-adaptive disposition is\
  \ of particular interest, because research on boredom in sports is scarce. Here,\
  \ we investigate the role of such individual differences in self-reported weekly\
  \ exercise behavior (in minutes) in a sample of N = 507 participants (n = 200 female,\
  \ Mage = 36.43 ($±$9.54)). We used the robust variant of Mahalanobis distance to\
  \ detect and remove n = 51 multivariate outliers and then performed latent profile\
  \ analysis to assess if boredom (boredom proneness; exercise-related boredom) and\
  \ self-control (trait self-control; if-then planning) combine into identifiable\
  \ latent profiles. In line with theoretical considerations, the Bayesian Information\
  \ Criterion favored a solution with two latent profiles. One profile was characterized\
  \ by higher-than-average exercise-related boredom and boredom proneness and lower-than-average\
  \ self-control and if-then planning values. This pattern was reversed for the second\
  \ profile. A one-sided Bayesian two-sample t-test supported the hypothesis that\
  \ the first profile is associated with less exercise behavior than the second profile,\
  \ BF = 16.93. Our results foster the notion of self-control and if-then planning\
  \ as adaptive dispositions. More importantly, they point to an important role of\
  \ boredom in the exercise setting: exercise-related boredom and getting easily bored\
  \ in general are associated with less exercise activity. This is in line with recent\
  \ theorizing on boredoms' and self-controls' function in guiding goal-directed behavior."
